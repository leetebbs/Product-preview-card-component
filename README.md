### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

I found that the initial layout and styling for mobile was difficult to re-style for desktop and so this is where i will focus my learning on the next challenges.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me reset all the css to start from a blank sheet,. I will be implementing the custom css reset in my future projects.
